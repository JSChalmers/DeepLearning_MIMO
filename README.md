# End-to-end Learning of MIMO and Multi-user Communication


This repository is based on joint work with Christian Häger, Jochen Schrodör, Timothy J. O'Shea, Erik Agrell and Henk Wymeersch. If you decide to use the source code for your research, please make sure to cite our paper(s):

We provide both TensorFlow and Pytorch implementations for all considered Auto-encoders.
Matlab code for the baseline schemes are also provide.
